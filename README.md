A collection of practice code and projects for CIT111: Introduction to Programming Java

## ABOUT ME
My name is Robert. I plan to be a Game Designer in the gaming industry. I enjoy playing video games on my computer and hanging out with my friends. I currently go to the Community College of Allegheny County and majoring in the Multimedia Programming, Simulation & Gaming A.S. program.

I'm new to Java and I am looking forward to learing about it even more while I am in the CIT111 class at CCAC.
